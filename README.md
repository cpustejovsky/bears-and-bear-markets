# Bears and Bear Markets

## Purpose
At my previous company, people would regularly want to have the financial news or price of cryptocurrency up on the screen. I preferred relaxing or cute animal videos. I had the idea to combine these two things into a single screen that could be displayed on an additonal monitor or on a large TV in a common area.

## Mockups
### Default View

### Settings View
