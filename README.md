# Bears and Bear Markets

## Purpose
At my previous company, people would regularly want to have the financial news or price of cryptocurrency up on the screen. I preferred relaxing or cute animal videos. I had the idea to combine these two things into a single screen that could be displayed on an additonal monitor or on a large TV in a common area.

## To-Dos
* ~~Display video player that displays live nature feed~~
* ~~Display of basic market info below header and above video player~~
* ~~when clicked, component displays more information about stock or market; view shifts~~
* ~~Settings to change video~~
* Refactor all functional components and hooks to use class based components and lifecycle methods
* Wire up API fetching into Redux with thunk or sagas
* Use Redux Form for settings
* Settings to change stock tickers displayed
  * ~~Dropdown of default settings~~
  * ~~Search for specific stocks~~
  * Cutomization via search and checkboxes
  * Customization of video playing
